##Welcome to COS!

Thank you for joining the Center for Open Science (COS) team. COS is a technology start-up with a non-profit agenda. It is a dynamic, innovative, aspirational, high-energy organization that aims to serve the scientific community. COS seeks to integrate and/or collaborate with other projects, organizations, and infrastructures rather than competing or reinventing. We put the values we preach into action daily and aim to be an employer of choice by engaging in open communication, having well defined values, and a strong team. COS’s most precious asset is you - the staff. Together, we will build state of the art tools and help to improve scientific practices.   

Sincerely,

Brian Nosek and Jeffrey Spies
Co-founders

##COS Mission and Values

The Center for Open Science (COS) was founded January 15, 2013. COS aims to increase the openness, integrity, and reproducibility of scientific research.  We achieve this mission through three primary activities: 

1. Developing, maintaining, and connecting infrastructures that support the research workflow and enable open practices.
2. Building a community of developers, scientists, and scientific stakeholders around open practices.
3. Conducting metascience research to improve the empirical evidence for the state of scientific practices and evaluation of means to improve those practices. 

##Daily Standup Meetings

The COS Team meets daily (M-F) at 9:00 AM in three groups; either meeting in the small room, big room, or bench room.  Room assignments are posted each week around the office.  Each staff member shares their main priority/goal for the previous day, and the current day.  The meeting is important and is <15 minutes. 

Catered Lunches:  On Tuesdays and Thursdays at 12:30 PM COS offers a catered lunch to the staff. Most lunches have a presenter or a planned topic of discussion. Please remember to fill in the food restrictions field in Zenefits.

Infrastructure Meetings: (Tuesdays 2 PM) The Developer team meets for an hour of planning tasks and presentation of mock-ups and/or working models. 

Steering Committee Meetings: (Wednesdays 2 PM) The Management team meets to discuss operational logistics of COS. 

Metascience Meetings: (Thursdays 2 PM) The Metascience team meets to discuss ongoing Metascience projects, to report progress and to provide general updates. 

Community Meetings: (Fridays at 2 PM) The Community team meets to strategize for upcoming events COS staff will be attending and participating, and for promoting COS activities and products. 

##Attendance

Digital technologies enable high connectivity at a distance. However, many of the COS projects benefit from real-time face-to-face contact whenever feasible. As such, the standard expectation is for team members to be present in the office during ordinary business hours. 

##Security and Office Access

COS offices will be accessible to full-time staff at all times - even during non-standard business hours. All full-time COS staff will receive an access card to Suite 500 for accessing the Omni Downtown Business Center during non-business hours. Notify the Office Manager if a pass is lost or broken.  Initial access cards will be provided and paid for by COS, but replacement passes (due to loss) will be the responsibility of the employee. All full-time staff must have a valid and working access card in order to support operations of COS.  The last full-time employee to leave the offices is responsible for making sure the front and back doors are locked and the security system is re-armed. (Note: this card is also used for parking at the Omni parking garage). If you encounter difficulties with the alarm system, contact information is located on the key panel for the appropriate staff members; immediately call the staff members listed to notify and report them of this difficulty. 

##Location

COS offices are located in the Business Center of the Downtown Omni Hotel which is within walking distance to the historic Charlottesville Downtown Mall.  The area boasts variety of locally owned restaurants, shops, bars, and music venues and is the social and commercial center of Charlottesville.  This prime location provides lifestyle value to the staff and is convenient for visitors to work with COS and enjoy the pleasures of Charlottesville.

##Dress Code

Staff can dress how they wish, following reasonable community standards for appropriate attire.  For example, there will be frequent visitors. COS is a casual, high-performance environment, but not an unkempt one.

##Paperless Office

We encourage digital signatures, scanning receipts, and digital communication. There is little reason or value in using paper when digital technologies allow duplication, extra security options, and easy sharing. COS uses Google Drive for storing and sharing documents. 

##Catered Meals and Fully Stocked Kitchen

The COS refrigerator and kitchen cabinets are fully stocked with the staff’s favorite snacks and beverages. If you notice the kitchen is out of something, write it on the blue dry erase board. If you have any special requests for snacks or beverages, let the Office Manager know.

Wednesdays and Fridays are left over days – many times there will be leftovers from Tuesday and Thursday’s catered lunches. Help yourself or take some home with you. Remember: if you’re the last person to eat left-overs, make sure to put them away and clean up. 

Also, as a community kitchen, each member of the community is responsible for its cleanliness.  When the dishwasher is full but dirty, start it.  When the dishwasher is full but clean, empty it.  Do not leave food or dishes on the counter, in the sink or around the office.

##Computing

We are an Apple shop and most of our staff use laptops. Some desks are equipped with 27" monitors for expanding the digital workspace.  If computing availability is not meeting your needs, discuss with the Office Manager to ensure that you have the computing resources needed for success.

##Parking

Full-time employees will be provided with a parking pass if needed. Because of limited parking and cost, full-time employees are encouraged to use alternative transportation instead of requesting a parking pass if possible.  Other COS team members will not have access to parking passes, and should likewise make use of bus routes, walking, and other modes of transportation. The [Charlottesville City Transit system](http://www.charlottesville.org/Index.aspx?page=3622) offers access to much of the area and all routes coverage at the Downtown Mall, right near the COS offices.  Please take a look at the map, and see how this will work for your transportation needs.  For full-time interns, COS can reimburse for monthly bus passes if needed. Bike parking is provided on the top level of the Omni parking garage.

##Air Travel Policy

COS prioritizes the health and well-being of its staff, and also needs staff members to be at their peak performance capacity when traveling for meetings or to give presentations.  Long distance travel can negatively impact well-being and performance.  As such, default practice is to send COS staff on economy class seats for domestic and international travel that is less than 7 hours flight time, and business class seats for international travel that is more than 7 hours flight time (plus Hawaii and Alaska from the east coast).  This policy may not apply when business class travel is explicitly barred by the funding source.

Business class seats are a considerable additional expense (often 300% more than the economy fare), and COS has a responsibility to be a good steward of its resources.  As such, upgrades to business class will be approached judiciously with the following principles to manage costs.

1. Travelers will seek affordable airfare options for all travel, but are encouraged to accumulate frequent flyer status on a single, preferred airline (travellers may choose the airline that best fits their common travel needs)
2. Frequent travelers that achieve higher status will earn miles for, but also more frequent “free” upgrades to business or first class travel
3. Frequent flyer miles earned are for the travelers’ personal use 
4. For most frequent flyer programs, automatic upgrades are given to frequent travelers for domestic flights when they are available
5. Some frequent flyer programs also give vouchers for global upgrades for very frequent travelers (e.g., 100,000 miles on United in a year earns 6 global upgrades for the following year).  These vouchers are applicable to certain ticket classes and are usually transferable to other travelers.  COS’s very frequent travelers may earn this status.  COS requests that its very frequent travelers apply these voucher upgrades to COS international flights by him- or herself or to other COS staff for their international travel. This way, COS would have a substantial investment for some international travel, but make this policy more sustainable by making efficient use of the status bonuses earned by frequent travelers.
6. If a frequent traveler has a significant portion of personal travel that contributed to earning free global upgrades, then he or she could proportionally distribute those upgrades for personal and business travel.  For example, if 6 global upgrades were earned and 33% of the travel was personal, then 2 of the upgrades would be for personal use.

Maintenance of this policy is contingent on effective application of cost efficiency strategies.  Without that, it is unlikely that this could be maintained on an ongoing basis.  As an alternative strategy to the above, COS will explore cost saving opportunities via business accounts with one or more airlines.  


##Gym Access

COS staff has access to the gym facilities at the Omni. This includes access to all exercise equipment, showers, whirlpool, and indoor and outdoor pools.  Up to two COS staff can use the facilities at a time.  Per an agreement with the Omni, if the gym is in heavy use by hotel guests, then COS staff would select another time to workout. 

The Office Manager keeps the gym passes in a small notebook complete with a sign in/sign out sheet to ensure the passes are never misplaced. Be sure to return the pass when you are done using it. 


##Flexible Work Schedule

COS is committed to the well-being of its staff. To honor this, COS allows flexible hours for medical appointments (doctors’ visit, dentist appointment and other necessary appointments to maintain well-being).  Appointments and time out of the office must be communicated with the Office Manager and your team. 

##Paid Time Off (PTO)

At the beginning of each year, COS employees receive credit for fifteen (15) days of “Paid Time Off” (PTO).  This benefit for new hires is pro-rated based upon the number of working days remaining in the calendar year. Upon termination all unused PTO will be forfeited. PTO is not accrued and has no cash value.  Staff must confirm PTO with their management and team. Anyone who cannot work due to an illness or emergency should notify the Office Manager.

##Leave for Unique Life Circumstances

COS employees may require additional time off in order to deal with a life changing event. To offer support in these circumstances, COS offers paid leave for up to three (3) months to all employees to care for their child after birth, after or during the adoption process, or to care for their spouse, son or daughter, or parent who has a serious health condition. All leave must be taken in the first year after the birth or adoption or the year in which they are caring for their family member. Leave can be taken for second and subsequent children. However, employees are not eligible for another (3) month period of leave unless the expected date of delivery or adoption is at least 12 months after your return to work from a previous period of parental leave.

##Paid Holidays

The following U.S. holidays are observed by COS and do not count against Paid Time Off credit: New Years Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Veterans Day, Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and New Years Eve.  We support cultural and community diversity.  If employees celebrate holidays that are not listed above, COS will provide a floating holiday option.

##Bereavement Leave

COS staff members will be paid for up to five (5) days to attend the funeral of a a family member.. If additional time-off is required, it is possible to arrange with the COS management team.  All other requests for time off in relation to bereavement will be decided on a case by case basis, as needed.
