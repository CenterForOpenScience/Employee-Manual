##Welcome to COS!

Thank you for joining the Center for Open Science (COS) team. COS is a technology start-up with a non-profit agenda. It is a dynamic, innovative, aspirational, high-energy organization that aims to serve the scientific community. COS seeks to integrate and/or collaborate with other projects, organizations, and infrastructures rather than competing or reinventing. We put the values we preach into action daily and aim to be an employer of choice by engaging in open communication, having well defined values, and a strong team. COS’s most precious asset is you - the staff. Together, we will build state of the art tools and help to improve scientific practices.   

Sincerely,

Brian Nosek and Jeffrey Spies

##COS Mission and Values

The Center for Open Science (COS) was founded January 15, 2013. COS aims to increase the openness, integrity, and reproducibility of scientific research.  We will achieve this mission through three primary activities: 

Developing, maintaining, and connecting infrastructures that support the research workflow and enable open practices.
Building a community of developers, scientists, and scientific stakeholders around open practices.
Conducting metascience research to improve the empirical evidence for the state of scientific practices and evaluation of means to improve those practices. 

##Daily Standup Meetings

The COS team meets daily (M-F) at 9:30 AM in the small conference room to share 1 major priority they will work on for that day. Prior to the meeting, each staff member is responsible for writing their main priority/goal for the day and crossing off any completed tasks from the previous day(s). During the next stand up meeting, if the priority has not been completed, staff members report obstacles they encountered in completing the task. If the task was successfully completed, the staff member notes a new task. The meeting is important and is <15 minutes.

Catered Lunches:  On Tuesdays and Thursdays at 12:15 PM COS offers a catered lunch to the staff. Most lunches have a presenter or a planned topic of discussion. If you have food restrictions or allergies, please notify the Office Manager.

Infrastructure Meetings: (Tuesdays 2 PM) The Developer team meets for an hour of planning tasks and presentation of mock-ups and/or working models. 

Steering Committee Meetings: (Wednesdays 2 PM) The Management team meets to discuss operational logistics of COS. 

Metascience Meetings: (Thursdays 2 PM) The Metascience team meets to discuss ongoing Metascience projects, to report progress and to provide general updates. 

Community Meetings: (Fridays at 2 PM) The Community team meets to strategize for upcoming events COS staff will be attending and participating, and for promoting COS activities and products. 


##Attendance

Digital technologies enable high connectivity at a distance. However, many of the COS projects benefit from real-time face-to-face contact whenever feasible. As such, the standard expectation is for team members to be present in the office during ordinary business hours. 

##Security and Office Access

COS offices will be accessible to full-time staff at all times - even during non-standard business hours. All full-time COS staff will receive an access card to Suite 500 for accessing the Omni Downtown Business Center during non-business hours. Should an access card be misplaced, please request a new copy from the Office Manager. The last person to leave the offices is responsible for making sure the front and back doors are locked and the security system is re-armed. (Note: this card is also used for parking at the Omni parking garage). 

##Location

COS offices are located in the Business Center of the Downtown Omni Hotel which is within walking distance to the historic Charlottesville Downtown Mall.  The area boasts variety of locally owned restaurants, shops, bars, and music venues and is the social and commercial center of Charlottesville.  This prime location provides lifestyle value to the staff and is convenient for visitors to work with COS and enjoy the pleasures of Charlottesville.

##Dress Code

Staff can dress how they wish, following reasonable community standards for appropriate attire.  For example, there will be frequent visitors. COS is a casual, high-performance environment, but not an unkempt one.

##Paperless Office

We encourage digital signatures, scanning receipts, and digital communication. There is little reason or value in using paper when digital technologies allow duplication, extra security options, and easy sharing. The COS has a server for storing and sharing documents that can be accessed while connected to the COS network or VPN. 

##Catered Meals and Fully Stocked Kitchen

COS fridge and kitchen cabinets are fully stocked with the staff’s favorite snacks and beverages (orders are placed at Harris Teeter each Tuesday afternoon). Wednesdays the kitchen will be replenished with snacks and beverages. If you notice the kitchen is out of something, write it on the blue dry erase board. If you have any special requests for snacks or beverages, let the Office Manager know. 

Fridays are left over days -- many times there will be leftovers from Tuesday and Thursday’s catered lunches. Re-help yourself or take some home with you! 

Also, as a community kitchen, each member of the community is responsible for its cleanliness.  When the dishwasher is full but dirty, start it.  When the dishwasher is full but clean, empty it.  Do not leave food or dishes on the counter or in the sink.


##Computing

We are an Apple shop and most of our staff use laptops. Some desks are equipped with 27" monitors for expanding the digital workspace.  If computing availability is not meeting your needs, discuss with the Office Manager to ensure that you have the computing resources needed for success.

##Parking

COS provides staff with parking passes for the Omni parking garage.  The pass can be used anytime, such as to access the Downtown Mall during weekends for extra curricular activities. There are days that the Omni hosts large events and the parking garage is full.  During those occasions when the parking garage is full, the COS employees are permitted use of the "Valet Parking" spots. Notify the Office Manager if a pass is lost or broken.  Also, notify the Office Manager if a parking pass is not needed or would be used infrequently as reducing the number of passes would be a substantial savings. For infrequent use, COS can issue daily permits.

##Gym Access

The COS staff has access to the gym facilities at the Omni. This includes access to all exercise equipment, showers, whirlpool, and indoor and outdoor pools.  Up to two COS staff can use the facilities at a time.  Per an agreement with the Omni, if the gym is in heavy use by hotel guests, then COS staff would select another time to workout. 

The Office Manager keeps the gym passes in a small notebook complete with a sign in/sign out sheet to ensure the passes are never misplaced. Be sure to return the pass when you are done using it. 


##Flexible Work Schedule

COS is committed to the well-being of its staff. To honor this, COS allows flexible hours for medical appointments (doctors’ visit, dentist appointment and other necessary appointments to maintain well-being).  Appointments and time out of the office should be noted in the shared Google COS calendar so that others are aware that you will be out of the office.

##Paid Time Off (PTO)

At the beginning of each year, COS employees receive credit for fifteen (15) days of “Paid Time Off” (PTO).  This benefit for new hires is pro-rated based upon the number of working days remaining in the calendar year. Upon termination all unused PTO will be forfeited. PTO is not accrued and has no cash value.  Staff must confirm PTO with management and indicate the time off on the COS Google shared calendar. Anyone who cannot work due to an illness or emergency should notify the Office Manager, Director, and Co-Director at minimum. 

##Leave for Unique Life Circumstances

COS employees may require additional time off in order to deal with a life changing event. To offer support in these circumstances, COS offers paid leave for up to three (3) months to all employees to care for their child after birth, after or during the adoption process, or to care for their spouse, son or daughter, or parent who has a serious health condition. All leave must be taken in the first year after the birth or adoption or the year in which they are caring for their family member. Leave can be taken for second and subsequent children. However, employees are not eligible for another (3) month period of leave unless the expected date of delivery or adoption is at least 12 months after your return to work from a previous period of parental leave.

##Paid Holidays

The following U.S. holidays are observed by COS and do not count against Paid Time Off credit: New Years Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Veterans Day, Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and New Years Eve.  We support cultural and community diversity.  If employees celebrate holidays that are not listed above, COS will provide a floating holiday option.

##Bereavement Leave

COS staff members will be paid for up to five (5) days to attend the funeral of an immediate family member (spouse, children, parents, grandparents, siblings or corresponding in-laws).  If additional time-off is required, it is possible to arrange with the COS management team.  

##Jury Duty

All full-time and part-time staff members will be excused with pay for five (5) days if called to serve jury duty.  

##Health Insurance

COS covers 100% of full-time employee premium costs under the [Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield](https://www.anthem.com/health-insurance/home/overview) [Keycare 20 plan](http://www.anthem.com/agent/va/f4/s0/t0/pw_ad091347.pdf) and 50% of all dependent coverage.  COS offers the option to buy up into the Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield [Keycare 20+ plan](http://www.anthem.com/agent/va/f4/s0/t0/pw_ad091356.pdf?refer=ahpagent&state=nv).  Employees will be responsible for paying cost difference between the two plans for both their individual coverage and any dependents under the Keycare 20+ plan.

At the time of hire, all new employees will receive plan summaries highlighting Keycare 20/Keycare 20+.  The Office Manager will discuss both plans with new hires to answer questions and help ensure their needs are being met by connecting them with Kim Garrison at Digital Benefit Advisors (kgarrison@digitalbenefitadvisors.com).  

Health insurance coverage will begin on the first day of the subsequent month in which employees are hired (i.e., hire date 06/15 - Insurance coverage will begin 07/01). 

Upon separation from COS, a voluntary "Continuation of Coverage" is extended for a maximum of 18-months/1.5 years.  Under this continuation, former employees can remain on the COS insurance plan, but are responsible for paying for the entire health insurance premium for themselves and their dependents by the 15th of each month.  All checks are to be mailed to 210 Ridge McIntire Road, Suite 500, Charlottesville, Virginia 22903. Additional information will be supplied during the time of separation. 

##Vision Insurance

COS will cover 100% of full-time employee and all dependent premium costs under Anthem’s [Blue View Vision plan](http://www.anthem.com/wps/portal/ahpfooter?content_path=national/va/f1/s0/t0/pw_b139691.htm&label=Blue%20View%20Vision%20Benefits). Vision insurance coverage will begin on the first day of the subsequent month in which employees are hired  (i.e., hire date 06/15 - Insurance coverage will begin 07/01). 

##Dental Insurance

COS will cover 100% of full-time employee premium costs and 50% of all dependent coverage under the [Guardian Dental Insurance plan](https://www.guardiananytime.com/). 

Dental insurance coverage will begin on the first day of the subsequent month in which employees are hired (i.e., hire date 06/15 - Insurance coverage will begin 07/01). 

##Principal 401(k)

COS full-time staff over the age of 21 are eligible to participate in the company’s 401(k) plan through [Principal Financial Group](http://www.principal.com/index.shtm). COS will offer a matching contribution of 100% up to 3% of pay and then another 50% up to 5% of pay (the full match will be 4% if participants elect to defer 5%). Employees are eligible for enrollment and immediate participation. At the time of initial employment, new employees will receive a 401(k) plan summary and enrollment package. 

All employees will be automatically enrolled within the 401(k) plan at the time of hire at an elective deferral rate of 6%. If employees wish to change their deferral rate to either lower or higher than 6%, they must login through the Principal website. New hires must notify the Office Manager via e-mail of their elective deferral contribution rate and whether their contributions are Roth or traditional prior to the first payroll period in which they are hired. Employees are able to modify their elective deferral rate at any time. If employees make changes to their contribution rates, they are to notify the Office Manager immediately as it impacts payroll. If you have questions regarding this information, please ask the Office Manager or consult Michael Joyce, our 401(k) plan advisor of NorthWestern Mutual [michael.t.joyce@nm.com](mailto:michael.t.joyce@nm.com).
